  Swimming through sick lullabies <br>
  Choking on your alibis <br>
  But it's just the price I pay <br>

  Open up my eager eyes <br>

  And it's all in my head <br>
  But she's touching his chest now <br>
  He takes off her dress now <br>
  Let me go <br>
  Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <br>
  And taking control <br>
  Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <br>
  Swimming through sick lullabies <br>
  Choking on your alibi <br>
  But it's just the price I pay <br>
  Destiny is calling me <br>
  Open up my eager eyes <br>
  Cause I'm Mr. Brightside <br>

  I never <br>
  I never" <br>
