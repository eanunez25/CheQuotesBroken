  `"Coming out of my cage <br>
  And I've been doing just fine <br>
  Gotta gotta be down  <br>
  Because I want it all <br>
  It started out with a kiss <br>
  How did it end up like this? <br>
  It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <br>
  Now I'm falling asleep <br>
  And she's calling a cab <br>
  While he's having a smoke <br>
  And she's taking a drag <br>
  Now they're going to bed <br>
  And my stomach is sick <br>
  And it's all in my head <br>
  But she's touching his chest now <br>
  He takes off her dress now <br>
  Let me go <br>
  And I just can't look, it's killing me <br>
  And taking control <br>
  Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <br>
  Swimming through sick lullabies <br>
  Choking on your alibis <br>
  But it's just the price I pay <br>
  Destiny is calling me <br>
  Open up my eager eyes <br>
  Cause I'm Mr. Brightside <br>
  I'm coming out of my cage <br>
  And I've been doing just fine <br>
  Gotta gotta be down <br>
  Because I want it all <br>
  It started out with a kiss <br>
  How did it end up like this? <br>
  (It was only a kiss), it was only a kiss <br>
  Now I'm falling asleep <br>
  And she's calling a cab <br>
  While he's having a smoke <br>
  And she's taking a drag <br>
  Now they're going to bed <br>
  And my stomach is sick <br>
  And it's all in my head <br>
  But she's touching his chest now <br>
  He takes off her dress now <br>
  Let me go <br>
  Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <br>
  And taking control <br>
  Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <br>
  Swimming through sick lullabies <br>
  Choking on your alibi <br>
  But it's just the price I pay <br>
  Destiny is calling me <br>
  Open up my eager eyes <br>
  Cause I'm Mr. Brightside <br>
  I never <br>
  I never <br>
  I never <br>
  I never" <br>
  -Marcelo when he poured his heart out to Rachael in front of all of SciTech and she wasn't even in the room, wtf che`,

  `"If you don't know what cinco de mayo is, it's a celebration of Mexico's 1862 victory in battle over France, although France, who previously had not won a war since 1066, later won the war against Mexico. However, since the Mexicans beat the French for this one battle, Mexicans took their cue from the Irish (who don't actually celebrate St. Patrick's Day, from what I can tell). The Mexicans said, "Okay, hey, let's do a pub crawl!!!!!' Except they said it in Spanish. Which makes me wonder why Mexicans would do a pub crawl, seeing as how Mexico doesn't seem to have a lot of pubs, seeing as how it's Mexico and not Ireland. But never mind that now. You should also never mind the fact that cinco de mayo is more widely celebrated here in the States than it is in Mexico." -Urban Dictionary`,
  `“I like butts, and I think about butts and I felt like making a butt song because I made a booby song so I was like, aight I’ll make a butt song.” -Doja Cat`,

  `“If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry.

  `"Aw hail no" -my neigborhood`,
  `"I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry" -Drake`,
  `"Pip Pip Da Doodly Doo" -Drake`,
  `"A few final thoughts, don't get married until you're thirty. Play laser tag once a week. Give at least as many high fives as you get. Teacup pigs are lady magnets, but are very hard to care for... Not worth the effort. The same goes for dogs and babies. And most importantly, whatever you do in this life... it's not legendary unless your friends are there to see it. Good luck boys. Take care of the game for me." -you already know`,
  `"Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace. 
  Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace. 
  Versace Versace, Versace Versace, Versace. 
  Versace Versace, Versace Versace, Versace. 
  Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace. 
  Versace Versace, Versace Versace, Versace. 
  Versace Versace, Versace Versace, Versace. 
  Versace Versace, Versace Versace." -Quavo, lyrical mastermind, discussing the corruption of capitalism`,
  `"The shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of self-governing. <br><br>
  To return the shopping cart is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct, appropriate thing to do. To return the shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct. <br><br>
  A person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it. <br><br>
  The Shopping Cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society."`,

  My big secret. I kill Kim Jong Un on opurpose. I good surgeon. The best!" <br><br>
  I hope you're inspired, future doctor.`,
  `<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLgzY8uL86U">"Juice is temporary. You could say that just 'cause you got a nice car or something, like 'Aw man, he got the juice'... it's something that kind of comes and goes. But the sauce: Sauce is forever."</blockquote> Gordon Terry, 21-year-old Best Buy employee`,
  `<blockquote>"'You only live once?' False. You live everyday. You only die once."</blockquote> Dwight Schrute, Manager`,
  `<blockquote>"Just do it."</blockquote> Shia Labeouf<br><br><img src="images/shia.gif">`,
